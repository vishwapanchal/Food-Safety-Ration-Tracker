# Food Safety Ration Tracker üõ°Ô∏è

The **Food Safety Ration Tracker** is a web application designed to help users manage food safety by tracking expiry dates and product information using image recognition. The app leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract expiry dates from images and barcodes from product packaging, integrating this data into a MongoDB database and allowing users to download a detailed PDF report.
